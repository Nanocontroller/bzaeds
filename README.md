# Teaching 8th graders to create AR for the web

Projects by 8th graders for WebAR using Multi-markers, AFrame and AR.js

A simple multimarker example using AFrame (0.9.2) and AR.js (2.0.8). 
Markers are in the markers folder.

The browser will ask (the first time) to access the camera feed, if available. 
On iOS check if Camera & Microphone Access is On under Settings -> Safari -> Privacy & Security section.
